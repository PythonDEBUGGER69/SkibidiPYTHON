#rules of defining variables
#1) variables cannot start with a digit/number
#1a = 50
#print (1a)       this is wrong way

aa = 20
print(aa)

#2) variables are case sensitive
a = 200
#print(A)                  wrong
print(a)
#3) variables must start with alphabet or underscore_
b = 200
print(b)
_b = 200
print (_b)
B = 1000
print(B)
